- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (Version: 5.3.2): TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) (Version: 2.10.3): ParcelJS is a web application package, it is a compiler for all your code, regardless of language.
